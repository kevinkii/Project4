# Visualizing Earning Based on College Majors
We are going to work with a dataset on job outcomes of students who graduated from college between 2010 and 2012. The original data on job outcomes was released by [American Community Survey](https://www.census.gov/programs-surveys/acs/), which conduts surveys and aggregates the data. FiveThirtyEight cleaned the dataset and released it on their [Github repo](https://github.com/fivethirtyeight/data/tree/master/college-majors).

Using visualizations, we can start to explore questions from the dataset like:

* Do students in more popular majors make more money?
  * Using scatter plots
* How many majors are predominantly male? Predominantly female?
  * Using histograms
* Which category of majors have the most students?
  * Using bar plots
